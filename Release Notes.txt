====
V1.3
==== 
------------
New Features
------------

1. Dynamic thread prioritization.

2. App feature: Biofeedback. In the trial page there is a biofeedback button. Pressing the button takes you to the biofeedback page.
The Force sensor signal is plotted and compared to the threshold supplied in the text field 
(10% == a 10% improvement relative to baseline).

3. Steps are tracked during a biofeedback session.

4. FSR signal is now normalized by baseline. Until walking calibration is complete no FSR signal is sent. 

5. App feature: Advanced torque mode allows the user to input absolute torque setpoints (Nm). 

6. App feature: Pause/Play buttons stop/start the motors during a trial. 

---------
Bug Fixes
---------

1. Fixed motor reset count sending

2. Fixed transmission frequency. It is now ~50Hz.
 
3. Fixed improper board definition that resulted in persistent motor driver errors.  

4. Fixed auto tracking correction (Auto_KF). Requires update of PID_V2 library.

-------------
Minor Updates
-------------

1. Modified transimission and control loop frequency.

2. Reset baseline values on end trial. 


====
V1.2
====
------------
New Features
------------

1. Added device identifier (EXOBLE_#)

2. Added torque transducer zero-offset log. Additional feature development needed.

3. Added exponential moving average (EMA) filter. Not currently implemented. Additional feature development needed.

---------
Bug Fixes
---------

1. Fixed bug with end trial functionality to ensure zero torque is prescribed on the next trial.

2. Fixed bug with PWM span.

-------------
Minor Updates
-------------

1. Updated torque transducer constant (470 Ohm resistor).

2. Cleaned received commands to minimize likelihood of erroneous mode switch (i.e. defined assistance in app but control is resistance).

3. Updated torque calibration function to use temporary variables when averaging torque data.
