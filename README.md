This branch is intended to be used with a thermocouple. The assembly, Nano and thermocouple IC w/ requisite jumper, will be fixed to an Exo. The assembly will connect to the
Biomotum phone app. The data will only stream when the trial is active. Only one of the real time signals will be populated, the others will be zero. The value being sent will
be in degrees Fahrenheit. The Thermocouple must be adhered to the test specimen, and the assembly must be connected to power via a LiIon cell. It is up to the user to monitor the state of the LiIon cell. After data collection the battery voltage should be tested. To charge the battery simply plug the nano into a usb port. I recommend that you first connect a phone to the thermocouple unit, and then power on the exo and connect to it.
