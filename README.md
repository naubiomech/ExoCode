This branch is intended to be used with a thermocouple. The assembly, Nano and thermocouple IC w/ requisite headers, will be fixed to an Exo. The assembly will connect to the
Biomotum phone app. The data will only stream when the trial is active. Only one of the real time signals will be populated, the others will be zero. The value being sent will
be in degrees Fahrenheit. The Thermocouple must be adhered to the test specimen, and the assembly must be connected to power and ground via the breakout pins. The red wire is
to be connected to power, the black wire to ground.
