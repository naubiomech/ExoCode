# Proportional Joint Moment Controller

## Description
This controller applies a torque to the ankle proportional to the normalized FSR reading of the toe.

## Parameters
Parameter index order can be found in [ControllerData.h](/ExoCode/src/ControllerData.h).
- max_torque - The peak torque in Nm.  When the normalized FSR torque is 1 this will be the torque at the ankle.
- is_assitance - When this is 1(assistive) the system will apply the torque in the plantar flexion direction, when 0(resistive) will be in the dorsiflexion direction.
- use_pid - This flag turns PID on(1) or off(0)
- p_gain - Proportional gain for closed loop controls
- i_gain - Integral gain for closed loop controls
- d_gain - Derivative gain for closed loop controls
