# Zhang Collins Controller

## Description
This controller applies a spline defined as a percent of gait.  This requires a heel FSR.
The profile is based on:

## Parameters
Parameter index order can be found in [ControllerData.h](https://github.com/naubiomech/ExoCode/blob/nano_teensy_board/ExoCode/src/ControllerData.h).
- mass - user mass kg

- t0 - ramp start percent gait
- t1 - torque onset percent gait
- t2 - peak torque point as percent gait
- t3 - offset as percent gait
- use_pid - This flag turns PID on(1) or off(0)
- p_gain - Proportional gain for closed loop controls
- i_gain - Integral gain for closed loop controls
- d_gain - Derivative gain for closed loop controls
