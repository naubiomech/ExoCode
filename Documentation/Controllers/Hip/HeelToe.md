# Heel Toe Controller

## Description
NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
This controller is designed to estimate the hip torque based on heel and toe FSR measurements and apply that torque to the hip joint.

## Parameters
Parameter index order can be found in [ControllerData.h](https://github.com/naubiomech/ExoCode/blob/nano_teensy_board/ExoCode/src/ControllerData.h).
- max_torque - Maximum torque to apply, i.e. hip flexion torque
- min_torque - Minimum torque to apply, i.e. hip extension torque
- use_pid - This flag turns PID on(1) or off(0)
- p_gain - Proportional gain for closed loop controls
- i_gain - Integral gain for closed loop controls
- d_gain - Derivative gain for closed loop controls
