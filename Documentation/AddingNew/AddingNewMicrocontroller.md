# Adding a new microcontroller
This file assumes you are still using Arduino.  
If you are moving away from Arduino you will need to remove Arduino specific items, like Serial.prints, pin defs that use A#.
Most of the code should run with little modification but there will be some reformatting to do, but if you are moving the code away from Arduino I am assuming you know enough to do this without my direction.

## Selecting microcontroller
    You should confirm that the microcontroller has the required elements.
    As of 20220517 this included:
        - Controller
            - SPI
            - CAN
            - 8 Analog Inputs
            - 9 Digital output
                - Ideally with 3 PWM for LED
            - 2 digital inputs
	    - Floating Point Unit
        - Coms
            - I2C
            - SPI
            - Bluetooth Low Energy
	    - IMU
            - Floating Point Unit
    It is also good to check that there are existing arduino libraries for the modules, ideally with identical interfaces.
        - SPI peripheral (slave) can be particularly challenging as most SPI libraries assume the microcontroller is the controller (master)

## Design board
    - When designing the board start from the current board as a template
    - In the schematic put components near where they are needed on the board. Particularly for capacitors and resistors where proximity matters
    - For the board file make sure those capacitors and resistors are where they belong
    - For the CAN bus place a restrict above the traces to prevent capacitive coupling on the lines.

## Board.h
    1. Create a new #define for your board where you define the name and a number for it.
    2. Create a new #elif for the new board, defining the pins for your board.
        - Add a #if defined([Microcontroller]), this will make sure the you can use pin names like A19 without throwing a compiling error when compiling for another board.
    3. Assign the pins based on the board design
        - Use the existing boards as a template.
    
## config.ini
    1. Add your board and version to the file
    
## ParseIni.h
    1. Add the board_name and board_version to the config_defs namespace
    2. for the controller board make sure that the std::map is available
    3. for the config_map namespace add the mapping for your board and version

## Other files
    Here is where it gets tricker
    1. Go through each of the files and add preprocessor defines around the areas that should compile for your microcontroller
        - for the controller micro you can add your micro to the #if defined(ARDUINO_TEENSY36)  || defined(ARDUINO_TEENSY41) 
        - for the coms micro you can add your micro to the #if defined(ARDUINO_ARDUINO_NANO33BLE)
        - There may be some locations were you need to add specific includes, ex. spi in ExoCode.ino
        - To find the name of your microcontroller to use in the defined([board])
            - go to the arduino directory/hardware/[type]/boards.txt
            - find your micro and look for *.board.name=[name]
            - in your define you will prepend this name with ARDUINO_
                - For example Teensy 4.1 is TEENSY41 so the define uses ARDUINO_TEENSY41
                - Be careful the Nano 33 is listed as ARDUINO_NANO33BLE so the define uses ARDUINO_ARDUINO_NANO33BLE
