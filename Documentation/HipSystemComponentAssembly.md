# Hip System Component Assembly 

## Hip Belt
- [x] Order Belts : Osprey IsoForm4 CM Custom Moldable Hipbelt - Women's
- [x] Make Mounting Plates : 2cm grid for 5M screw clearance, should be horizontal when worn. Material Kydex or PVC/Acrylic https://www.mcmaster.com/8650K11 can go thinner if needed.
- [x] Drill Mounting Holes : Through belt side first layer for M5 screw clearance
- [x] Make Holes for mounting electrical box with template, M3 Clearnce

## Electrical Box
- [x] Populate PCB following Eagle files https://github.com/ChanceCuddeback/TMotor_Exo_PCB/tree/WithTeensy
- [x] Print box : Found in Eiger under Paul/Electrical Box
- [ ] Populate Panel with Switches and LEDs
- [ ] Place threaded inserts in printed components
- [ ] Make and mount cable for battery connection to PCB
- [ ] Mount PCB with the thin base behind it to protect against shorts
- [x] Make cable to connect power from PCB to motors XT30 plug on one side and receptical on the other.
- [x] Make cable to connect CAN from PCB to motor, 2 pin Molex Pico-Clasp on one side, CJT 2 or 4 pin connector on other depending on motor connector.
- [ ] Make FSR Cable
