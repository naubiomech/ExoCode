# Adding a new CAN motor
## parseIni.h
1. Go to the config_defs namespace and add an enumeration to the motor enum.
2. Go to the config_map namespace and add a case for your new motor in the motor mapping.

## Motor.h
1. Define a new CAN motor class. To define a motor class, copy and paste the other CAN motor classes at the bottom of the file and change the name. 
  Make sure the class name is unique and descriptive.

## Motor.cpp
1. Define the constructor for your new class. Following the other CAN classes, define your _T_MAX and _V_MAX to reflect the motors maximal torque
  and velocity respectively. You can find these values on the motors datasheet. 

## Joint.cpp
1. For each Joint constructor, add a case to the switch statement for your motor. 

## Done 
Modify the config.ini file to use your new motors!
