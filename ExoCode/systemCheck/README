# System Check
## Purpose
This folder is intended to provide tools for checking the function of individual components of the system.

## Use
There are different Arduino sketch folders for the different system checks.
If you are using the sketches you will need to copy the src folder from the main ExoCode here to make sure you have the most recent copy.
DO NOT commit these src subfolders, the .gitignore should take care of it but just to be safe.
